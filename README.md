# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Welcome to my **100 Days of SwiftUI** challenge! This repository documents my journey through Paul Hudson's SwiftUI course [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui].

Each day is tracked through individual branches to showcase daily progress and lessons. The goal is to improve my SwiftUI skills, deepen my understanding of iOS development, and apply best coding practices.
